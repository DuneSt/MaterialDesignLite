Description
--------------------

The Material Design Lite (MDL) slider component is an enhanced version of the new HTML5 <input type="range"> element. A slider consists of a horizontal line upon which sits a small, movable disc (the thumb) and, typically, text that clearly communicates a value that will be set when the user moves it.

Example
--------------------

	html mdlSlider
		min: 0;
		max: 100;
		value: 75
