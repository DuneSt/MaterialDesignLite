The Material Design Lite (MDL) switch component is an enhanced version of the standard HTML <input type="checkbox"> element. A switch consists of a short horizontal "track" with a prominent circular state indicator and, typically, text that clearly communicates a binary condition that will be set or unset when the user clicks or touches it.
