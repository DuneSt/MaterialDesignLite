I am the main demo of this project.
Use me to see what components look like, and how to include it into your own project.

Low level components are described with associated smalltalk code.

High level widgets will be integrated to the demo soon.


This application is also a demo to show you how to subclass MDLApplication and how to use layout.
We've been creating a custom header section to compose our own layout widget.
